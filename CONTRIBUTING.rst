Device detection issues
=======================

If you're encountering issues with device detection, including
device info detection (like missing serial numbers)
or port identification issues (like multi-port devices being indistinguishable)
then please `open a new issue`_.

When opening the issue, please **attach the file**
generated by the ``pyserial-generate-test-asset`` command.
(Please don't copy-and-paste its output.)

Not all platforms are supported by that command yet,
but if yours is supported it will be very helpful
for understanding the current state of the system and device.

The command requires the device name that you're seeing issues with,
(like ``/dev/ttyS0``) as well as the name of a file to write information to.
For example:

..  code-block::

    pyserial-generate-test-asset -o test-asset.json /dev/ttyGS0

For multi-port devices, please add multiple paths to the same command
so that all of the relevant information appears in the same file.
For example:

..  code-block::

    pyserial-generate-test-asset -o test-asset.json /dev/ttyAP0 /dev/ttyAP1

After generating the test asset file, you can edit the ``"context"`` section
to include relevant information about the device(s).
Editing the file is not required, but such information must be included
in the issue.
